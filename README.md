# FreePBX-CloudMagic
*NOT IN BETA OR EVEN THETA, THIS WILL BREAK YOUR SYSTEM*  Dockerfile to build out all required dependencies and FreePBX for Amazon AWS ECS/EC2 Service.

This is to learn limitations, possible integrations, symptoms, and causes of issues.  

Outside collaborators are welcome that are interested in breaking things on purpose
